## How Moderation Works

Content moderation on SyriaHub follows a layered approach designed to catch problems early while preserving human judgment for complex cases.

### The Moderation Flow

```
1. AI Pre-Filter
   ↓
2. Community Reports
   ↓
3. Human Moderators
   ↓
4. Jury Panel (appeals only)
```

**Layer 1: AI Pre-Filter**
All submitted content passes through automated moderation that checks for:
- Harassment and hate speech
- Spam and low-effort content
- Potential plagiarism (semantic similarity detection)

Content flagged by AI is held for human review. Content that passes continues to publication.

**Layer 2: Community Reports**
Any user can report content they believe violates community standards. Reports require an explanation (minimum 10 characters) and cannot be submitted for your own content.

**Layer 3: Human Moderators**
Moderators review:
- AI-flagged content
- Community reports
- Appeals from rejected content

Moderators can approve, request revisions, or reject content. All decisions include explanations visible to the author.

**Layer 4: Jury Panel**
Complex or contested cases go to a jury panel—multiple moderators who review independently and vote. This prevents individual bias from determining outcomes.

## What Trust Scores Mean

Trust scores appear on user profiles and reflect **content quality consistency**, not personal worth.

### What Trust Scores Represent
- How often a user's content passes moderation without issues
- Citation quality (proper attribution, accurate references)
- Community reception (helpful answers, constructive comments)
- Longevity (sustained contribution over time)

### What Trust Scores Do NOT Represent
- Intelligence or expertise
- Correctness of conclusions
- Authority on any topic
- Permission to bypass moderation

**Important:** A high trust score means someone contributes consistently within community standards. It does not mean their research conclusions are correct.

## How AI Is Constrained

SyriaHub uses AI for specific, limited purposes. Here are the constraints:

| AI Feature | Constraint |
|------------|------------|
| Content moderation | Flags only; humans make final decisions |
| Plagiarism detection | Suggests similarity; humans verify |
| Question advisor | Uses hedging language; suggestions only |
| Pattern detection | Session-only; dismissible; no persistence |

### AI Principles

1. **Transparency**: Users know when AI is involved
2. **Reversibility**: AI decisions can be overridden
3. **No profiling**: AI does not build user models
4. **Hedging language**: AI never speaks with false certainty

## How Disputes Are Handled

### Content Rejection Appeals
1. Author receives rejection with explanation
2. Author can submit appeal with counter-argument
3. Different moderator reviews appeal
4. For complex cases, jury panel votes

### Plagiarism Disputes
1. AI flags high-similarity content (>85%)
2. Moderator reviews original and flagged content
3. Author can provide explanation (common sources, parallel development)
4. Moderator makes final determination

### Research Gap Disputes
1. User disputes gap status or resolution
2. Moderator reviews gap claims and linked posts
3. Community input considered for contested gaps
4. Resolution documented with reasoning

## What SyriaHub Will Not Do

| Non-Goal | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Profile users behaviorally | Undermines researcher autonomy |
| Rank people by "influence" | Creates perverse status hierarchies |
| Optimize for engagement | Distorts research priorities |
| Personalize content feeds | Creates filter bubbles |
| Sell user data | Violates trust fundamentally |
| Allow anonymous moderation | Accountability requires identity |

## Limits of Authority

Power is safer when its limits are written down.

### What Moderators Cannot Do
- Delete content without explanation
- Reject content for disagreeing with conclusions
- Access private messages or drafts
- Permanently ban users without admin approval
- Override jury panel decisions
- Modify content (only approve, reject, or request revision)

### What Admins Should Not Decide
- Which research conclusions are "correct"
- Which topics are too controversial to discuss
- Who counts as a "real" researcher
- Exceptions to moderation rules for specific users
- Content removal based on external pressure without review

### What Remains Unresolved By Design
Some tensions are inherent and should not be "solved":
- **Accessibility vs. rigor**: Content should be both accessible and rigorous; we don't pick one
- **Speed vs. thoroughness**: Quick publication vs. careful review; case-by-case judgment
- **Openness vs. quality control**: Invite-only maintains quality but limits access; ongoing balance

These are not problems to fix but tensions to manage thoughtfully.
