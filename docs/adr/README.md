# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the SyriaHub platform.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a software project. They provide context, rationale, and consequences for decisions that shape the system's structure.

When making significant architectural decisions, please create a new ADR:

1. Copy the template from `0001-adr-template.md`
2. Number it sequentially (e.g., `0004-your-decision.md`)
3. Fill in all sections
4. Submit for review with your PR

## When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when:
- Choosing between multiple viable approaches
- Making a decision that will be hard to reverse
- Establishing a pattern others should follow
- Deprecating or replacing an existing approach
