## Choosing the Right Content Type

Before writing, consider what you're contributing:

| If you want to... | Use... |
|-------------------|--------|
| Present original research, analysis, or argument | **Article** |
| Ask the community a specific question | **Question** |
| Preserve a primary source (document, photo, testimony) | **Trace** |
| Identify knowledge that doesn't exist yet | **Research Gap** |

### Article vs Trace
**Articles** contain analysis and conclusions. **Traces** preserve evidence with minimal interpretation.

Example:
- "An analysis of displacement patterns in Idlib 2019-2020" → **Article**
- "Photographs from Maarat al-Numan, February 2020" → **Trace**

### Article vs Question
**Articles** share what you've learned. **Questions** seek what you don't know.

If you're uncertain whether you have enough for an article, consider posting a question first to gather perspectives.

## Writing Epistemically Sound Posts

Good contributions on SyriaHub remain useful even when disagreed with. Here's how:

### State Claims Clearly
- Be explicit about what you're claiming
- Distinguish between observations, interpretations, and recommendations
- Say "I argue that..." not "It is clear that..."

### Show Your Evidence
- Cite sources for factual claims
- Link to SyriaHub content when relevant
- Acknowledge when evidence is limited

### Use Hedging Language Appropriately
| Instead of... | Consider... |
|---------------|-------------|
| "This proves..." | "This suggests..." |
| "Clearly..." | "The evidence indicates..." |
| "Everyone agrees..." | "Several sources report..." |
| "X caused Y" | "X may have contributed to Y" |

### Acknowledge Uncertainty
- State what you don't know
- Note limitations of your sources
- Mention alternative interpretations you considered

### Specify Scope
- Set temporal coverage (what time period?)
- Set spatial coverage (what geographic area?)
- Be explicit about what's not covered

## Claiming and Resolving Research Gaps

### Finding Gaps
Browse the Research Gaps section in the Research Lab. Gaps are organized by:
- Type (data, methodological, interpretive, population, regional, temporal)
- Priority (community upvotes)
- Status (open, claimed, resolved)

### Claiming a Gap
1. Find a gap that matches your research interests
2. Click "Claim" to indicate you're working on it
3. Multiple researchers can claim the same gap
4. Claims have no deadline—they signal intent, not commitment

### Working a Gap
- Gap claims are coordination signals, not contracts
- Communicate in gap discussions if helpful
- Partial progress is valuable

### Resolving a Gap
1. Publish a post that addresses the gap
2. Link the post to the gap when publishing
3. The gap status updates to show linked posts
4. Community can mark gaps as "resolved" when adequately addressed

## How Citations and Forks Affect Trust

### Citing Others
When you cite SyriaHub content:
- A backlink appears on the cited post
- Your citation is typed (supports, extends, challenges)
- This builds the knowledge network

Good citation practice:
- Cite primary sources when possible
- Acknowledge work that influenced your thinking
- Be accurate about what you're citing

### Being Cited
When others cite your work:
- Citation backlinks appear on your post
- This indicates influence, not endorsement
- More citations generally increase trust score

### Forking Others
When you fork:
- Attribution is automatic
- The original author sees your fork
- Your trust is independent of the original

Fork etiquette:
- Add meaningful value
- State how your version differs
- Don't fork just to claim credit

| Proper attribution | High view count |
| Useful even when challenged | Uncontested |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Good researchers appreciate knowing what not to do:

### Overstating Certainty
**Problem:** Presenting conclusions as more certain than evidence warrants.
**Signs:** "Clearly...", "Undoubtedly...", "The evidence proves..."
**Fix:** Use hedging language. Acknowledge limitations.

### Treating Awareness Flags as Conclusions
**Problem:** Citing spatial pattern flags as if they were research findings.
**Signs:** "SyriaHub detected that X is a network bottleneck..."
**Fix:** Flags suggest questions, not answers. Investigate before concluding.

### Using Gaps to Push Agendas
**Problem:** Creating research gaps to suggest conclusions rather than identify genuine absences.
**Signs:** Leading gap titles, gaps that presuppose answers.
**Fix:** Gaps should be open questions, not rhetorical devices.

### Forking Without Adding Value
**Problem:** Forking content with trivial changes to claim parallel credit.
**Signs:** Forks that only change wording or structure slightly.
**Fix:** Fork when you're genuinely extending or adapting work.

### Citation Padding
**Problem:** Adding citations that don't support your claims to appear more rigorous.
**Signs:** References that aren't actually relevant to your argument.
**Fix:** Every citation should do work. Cut the rest.

### Scope Creep Without Acknowledgment
**Problem:** Making claims beyond your stated temporal or spatial scope.
**Signs:** Title says "Aleppo 2020" but conclusions discuss all of Syria.
**Fix:** If scope expands, update your coverage fields and acknowledge limitations.

## Tips for Success

1. **Complete your profile**: Affiliation and bio add context to your contributions
2. **Start with questions**: If unsure, ask the community before publishing
3. **Cite generously**: Attribution builds the network and your reputation
4. **Engage constructively**: Comments and answers contribute to trust
5. **Claim gaps strategically**: Only claim what you intend to pursue
6. **Review before publishing**: The 24-hour edit window is for typos, not rewrites
