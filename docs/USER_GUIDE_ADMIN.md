## The Moderation Mindset

Moderation on SyriaHub is about **maintaining epistemic standards**, not enforcing opinions. Your role is to:
- Ensure content meets community standards
- Protect against bad-faith contributions
- Preserve space for legitimate disagreement
- Support the appeals process fairly

You are a guardian of process, not arbiter of truth.

---

## Moderation Flow

### Queue Management
The moderation queue shows:
- AI-flagged content awaiting human review
- Community reports awaiting action
- Appeals awaiting decision

**Priority order:**
1. Appeals (time-sensitive for authors)
2. AI flags with high confidence
3. Community reports
4. AI flags with lower confidence

### Status Transitions

| Status | Meaning | Next Actions |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Pending** | Awaiting first review | Review → Approve/Reject/Request Revision |
| **Reviewing** | Under active consideration | Continue review → Decide |
| **Approved** | Content is live | No action needed |
| **Rejected** | Content removed | Author may appeal |
| **Revision Requested** | Author asked to modify | Await revision |

### Bulk Actions
Use bulk approve/reject sparingly. Each piece of content deserves individual consideration for anything beyond obvious spam.

## Appeals & Revisions

### Handling Appeals
When an author appeals rejection:

1. **Read the original rejection reason** — What was the concern?
2. **Read the appeal** — What is the author's counter-argument?
3. **You are a different reviewer** — You should not have made the original decision
4. **Consider independently** — Don't defer to the original moderator
5. **Decide on merits** — Was the rejection justified? Has the author addressed concerns?

### Communicating Decisions
For rejections and revision requests:
- Be specific about what the problem is
- Explain what would make the content acceptable
- Stay neutral in tone
- Don't lecture—state facts

**Good:** "The claims in paragraphs 3-4 lack citations. Please add sources for the statistics mentioned."

**Avoid:** "You really should know better than to make unsourced claims."

### When to Request Revision vs Reject
| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Good content with fixable issues | Request revision |
| Fundamental problems with approach | Reject with clear explanation |
| Bad faith or spam | Reject immediately |
| Borderline case | Discuss with another moderator |

## Handling Plagiarism Flags

The AI plagiarism system flags content with >85% semantic similarity to existing content.

### False Positives Are Common
Many flags are legitimate:
- Common sources (same data, same quotes)
- Parallel development (researchers reached similar conclusions)
- Proper quotation (long quotes trigger similarity)
- Self-plagiarism (author reusing their own prior work)

### Review Process
1. **Compare the flagged content to the match** — Is it actually similar?
2. **Check citations** — Did the author properly attribute?
3. **Consider context** — Is similarity problematic here?
4. **Make judgment** — Dismiss, request revision, or reject

### When Similarity Is Acceptable
- Author quoted and cited the source
- Content is factual/common knowledge
- Author is building on their own prior work
- Similarity is structural, not substantive

### When Similarity Is Problematic
- Substantive content copied without attribution
- Author claims originality for derivative work
- Pattern of copying across multiple posts

## Managing Research Gaps

### Gap Moderation
Research gaps can be:
- Legitimate questions about knowledge absences
- Rhetorical devices disguised as questions
- Duplicates of existing gaps

**Check for:**
- Is the gap genuinely open? (Not a leading question)
- Is it specific enough to be actionable?
- Does it duplicate an existing gap?

### Gap Claims and Disputes
Multiple researchers can claim the same gap. This is normal and encouraged—coordination happens in gap discussions.

If a user disputes another's claim:
- Claims are non-exclusive by design
- No action needed unless there's bad behavior
- Focus on whether the gap itself is appropriate

### Resolution Verification
When gaps are marked resolved:
- Linked posts should actually address the gap
- Partial resolution is valid
- Community can reopen if inadequately addressed

---

## When Not to Intervene

Moderation should be minimal effective action. Some situations don't require intervention:

### Legitimate Disagreement
Researchers disagreeing about interpretations is healthy. Unless the disagreement becomes harassment, let it unfold.

### Politically Sensitive but Well-Sourced
Content can be politically sensitive and still meet quality standards. Don't reject because a topic is controversial—evaluate the claims and evidence.

### Unpopular Conclusions
Community downvotes are not grounds for moderation. If content meets standards, it stays regardless of reception.

### Style Differences
Not everyone writes the same way. Focus on substance, not preferences.

### Over-Eagerness
Sometimes the right action is no action. Default to preserving content unless there's clear cause for removal.

---

## Hard Calls

Some moderation decisions have no clear answer. Here's how to approach them:

### Politically Sensitive but Well-Cited Content
The content is controversial but properly sourced and argues in good faith.

**Approach:**
- Evaluate claims and evidence, not conclusions
- Verify citations actually support claims made
- Consider whether hedging language is appropriate
- If standards are met, approve regardless of politics

**Permission granted:** You don't have to agree with content to approve it.

### Conflicting High-Quality Sources
Two pieces of content cite credible sources that contradict each other.

**Approach:**
- Both can be published
- Consider adding relationship links ("challenges" relationship)
- Don't adjudicate which source is correct
- Let the scholarly record show the disagreement

**Permission granted:** Contradiction is not a moderation problem.

### Heated Debates That Are Epistemically Valid
Discussion is intense but participants are arguing on substance, not attacking each other.

**Approach:**
- Monitor but don't intervene
- Distinguish heat from harassment
- Let researchers work through disagreement
- Step in only if it crosses into personal attacks

**Permission granted:** Academic debate can be vigorous.

## Escalation

### When to Escalate to Jury Panel
- Appeals where you're unsure
- Claims of moderator bias
- High-profile or sensitive content
- Policy edge cases

### When to Escalate to Administrators
- Patterns of bad behavior across multiple posts
- Suspected coordinated manipulation
- Technical issues with moderation systems
- Requests for permanent actions (bans)

---

## Final Notes

- Document your reasoning, especially for rejections
- Ask for help when uncertain
- Err on the side of preserving content
- Remember: you're maintaining standards, not enforcing views
