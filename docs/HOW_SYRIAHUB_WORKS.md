# How SyriaHub Works

## Mental Model

**SyriaHub is closer to a shared research notebook than a forum.**

Contributions are expected to remain useful even when disagreed with. Unlike social platforms optimized for engagement, SyriaHub is designed for knowledge that accumulates, connects, and persists. Your work here becomes part of a collective record—referenced, extended, and sometimes challenged by others.

## Content Types

SyriaHub supports distinct content types, each serving a different epistemic purpose.

### Article
Long-form research with citations, analysis, and conclusions.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Presenting research findings, analysis, arguments |
| **Structure** | Markdown with sections, citations, optional cover image |
| **Versioning** | 24-hour edit window, then version history |
| **Best for** | Original research, literature reviews, policy analysis |

### Question
Community Q&A with voting and accepted answers.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Seeking specific information or perspectives |
| **Structure** | Clear question with context; answers ranked by votes |
| **Resolution** | Asker can mark an accepted answer |
| **Best for** | Factual queries, seeking sources, methodological advice |

### Trace
Collective memory artefacts—primary sources preserved for the record.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Preserving evidence, testimony, documentation |
| **Structure** | Minimal analysis; focus on source material |
| **Handling** | Treated as archival material |
| **Best for** | Photographs, documents, oral testimonies, maps |

### Research Gap
Identified absences in current knowledge.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Mapping what we don't know |
| **Types** | Data, methodological, interpretive, population, regional, temporal |
| **Lifecycle** | Identified → Upvoted → Claimed → Worked → Resolved |
| **Best for** | Coordinating research priorities, avoiding duplication |

## Forking & Attribution

Content on SyriaHub can be forked—creating a new version that builds on the original while maintaining attribution.

### How Forking Works
1. Click "Fork" on any post
2. A new draft is created with the original content
3. Edit and extend as needed
4. On publish, your fork links back to the original
5. The original shows your fork in its "Forks" section

### Fork Etiquette
- **Add value**: Forks should meaningfully extend or adapt the original
- **Credit clearly**: Attribution is automatic, but acknowledge in your text too
- **Different purpose**: Fork when you're taking work in a new direction, not just editing

### Licenses
Authors choose licenses when publishing. Forks inherit license obligations:
- **CC BY 4.0**: Fork freely with attribution
- **CC BY-SA 4.0**: Forks must use the same license
- **CC BY-NC 4.0**: Non-commercial forks only
- **All Rights Reserved**: Contact author before forking

## Citations & Versioning

### The Citation System
When you cite another SyriaHub post:
- A citation link appears in your references section
- A backlink appears on the cited post ("Cited by...")
- The citation relationship is typed (supports, extends, challenges)

### Version History
- **24-hour edit window**: After publishing, you have 24 hours to make corrections without creating a new version
- **After 24 hours**: Edits create a new version; all versions are retained
- **Diff viewer**: Anyone can compare versions to see what changed

### Why This Matters
Version history prevents silent revision of claims. If you change your conclusion, readers can see the original. This supports accountability and tracks how understanding evolves.

## Spatial Context & Awareness Flags

### Geographic Tagging
Posts can specify:
- **Point locations**: Specific coordinates
- **Circular regions**: Area around a point
- **Polygon regions**: Custom-drawn boundaries

### Temporal Coverage
Posts specify the time period they cover (e.g., "January 2023 – December 2024").

### Awareness Flags
The spatial engine may detect patterns worth investigation:
- Network bottlenecks (infrastructure gaps)
- Service coverage questions
- Cross-boundary dynamics
- Access discontinuities

**Important:** Flags are suggestions, not conclusions. They use hedging language ("may indicate", "could suggest") and are:
- Dismissible (click to hide)
- Session-only (don't persist across visits)
- Never stored as metadata on posts

## Research Gaps Lifecycle

Research gaps map what we don't know, helping coordinate effort and avoid duplication.

### The Lifecycle

```
1. IDENTIFY
   Someone notices a gap and creates a Gap entry
   ↓
2. UPVOTE
   Community signals priority through upvotes
   ↓
3. CLAIM
   A researcher claims the gap to work on it
   ↓
4. WORK
   Research conducted (may take weeks/months)
   ↓
5. RESOLVE
   Publish a post addressing the gap; link them together
```

### Gap Types
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Data** | Missing datasets or measurements |
| **Methodological** | No established approach exists |
| **Interpretive** | Data exists but meaning is contested |
| **Population** | Certain groups are underrepresented |
| **Regional** | Certain areas are understudied |
| **Temporal** | Certain time periods lack coverage |

### Collaboration
- Multiple researchers can work on the same gap
- Gaps can be addressed by multiple posts
- Partial resolutions are valid

## What You're Part Of

When you contribute to SyriaHub, you're participating in:
- **A persistent record**: Content is versioned and preserved
- **A citation network**: Your work connects to and is connected by others
- **A gap-mapping effort**: Collective identification of what needs research
- **A trust system**: Quality over time builds reputation
- **An epistemic community**: Standards matter more than engagement

Welcome.
